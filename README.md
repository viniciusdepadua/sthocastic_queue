# sthocastic_queue
Little Project made with the purpose to simulate the size of an hospital queue

In an hospital there are 2 medical doctor working. The hospital opens at 9am and pacients starts to arrive following a poisson with rate parameter equals to 10 minutes. Pacients can be consulted by either of the M.D. The pacients awaits in a queue till one of the M.D are free to consult. Each consult is a Uniformly distributed random variable between 5 and 20 minute. At 4pm, the hospital no longer accepts new pacients and only closes after the last pacient was consulted.

Some of the results:
